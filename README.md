# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
Import the numpy module to use the built-in functions for calculation
### Step 2:
Mention the coordinates as given
### Step 3:
Substitute the values in the distance formula

import numpy as np
l1=[10,6]
l2=[4,2]
distance=np.sqrt(((l1[0]-l2[0])**2)+((l1[1]-l2[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))

```
